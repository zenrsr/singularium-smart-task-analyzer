## Project Structure

### Frontend (Modular Architecture)
The frontend has been refactored from a monolithic script into a clean, modular ES6 architecture:

```
frontend/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── styles.css          # Global styles
└── js/
    ├── main.js         # App initialization & event handling
    ├── state.js        # Global state & constants
    ├── api.js          # API communication layer
    ├── ui.js           # DOM manipulation & rendering
    ├── visualizations.js # Canvas graphs & Matrix
    └── utils.js        # Helper functions
```

### Backend (Django)
Standard Django project structure with a `tasks` app handling all logic.

## Algorithm Explanation

### Smart Balance Scorer (Default)

The core scoring algorithm uses a **weighted multi-factor approach** to intelligently prioritize tasks:

#### Scoring Components:

1. **Urgency (40% weight)**
   - **Overdue tasks**: Maximum priority (+100 points)
   - **Due today**: +90 points
   - **Due tomorrow**: +80 points
   - **Due within 3 days**: +50 points
   - **Due within 7 days**: +30 points
   - **Later**: Decreasing priority

   **Rationale**: Urgency is weighted highest because missed deadlines have immediate negative consequences. Overdue tasks receive the maximum boost to ensure they're addressed first.

2. **Importance (30% weight)**
   - User-provided rating (1-10 scale) multiplied by 10
   - High importance (8-10): Critical tasks that align with goals
   - Medium importance (5-7): Standard priority
   - Low importance (1-4): Nice-to-have tasks

   **Rationale**: Importance is second-highest because it represents the strategic value of a task, even if not immediately urgent.

3. **Effort (20% weight)**
   - **Quick wins** (<2 hours): +20 points bonus
   - **Moderate** (2-4 hours): +10 points
   - **Standard** (4-8 hours): Neutral
   - **Large** (>8 hours): -10 points penalty

   **Rationale**: Quick wins build momentum and provide psychological benefits. The algorithm slightly favors them to encourage progress.

4. **Dependencies (10% weight)**
   - **Blockers** (tasks that block others): +15 points per dependent task
   - **Blocked** (tasks waiting on dependencies): -20 points

   **Rationale**: Tasks that unblock others should be prioritized to prevent bottlenecks. Blocked tasks naturally rank lower until dependencies are resolved.

#### Example Calculation:

```
Task: "Deploy hotfix"
- Due: Tomorrow (Urgency = 80)
- Importance: 9/10 (Importance = 90)
- Effort: 1 hour (Effort = 20)
- Blocks 2 tasks (Dependencies = 30)

Score = (80 × 0.4) + (90 × 0.3) + (20 × 0.2) + (30 × 0.1)
      = 32 + 27 + 4 + 3
      = 66 (HIGH priority)
```

### Alternative Strategies

1. **Fastest Wins**: Sorts by `estimated_hours` (ascending) - tackle quick tasks first
2. **High Impact**: Sorts by `importance` only - focus on high-value work
3. **Deadline Driven**: Sorts by `due_date` only - strict deadline adherence

### Advanced Configuration

Users can customize the weights via the Advanced Config panel. Weights must sum to 100% and are applied to the Smart Balance algorithm only. This allows users to tune the algorithm to their workflow (e.g., more weight on importance for strategic work, or more on urgency during crunch time).

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Strategy Pattern for Scoring
**Decision**: Implemented different scoring strategies as separate classes using the Strategy Pattern.

**Rationale**: 
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new strategies without modifying existing code
- Testable in isolation
- Follows SOLID principles (Open/Closed)

### 2. Optional Advanced Configuration
**Decision**: Made weight customization an opt-in feature accessible via collapsible panel.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents overwhelming new users with too many options
- Progressive disclosure UX pattern
- Sensible defaults work for 90% of use cases
- Power users can fine-tune when needed

### 3. Circular Dependency Detection
**Decision**: Implemented DFS-based cycle detection algorithm.

**Rationale**:
- Graph problems require graph algorithms - DFS is optimal for cycle detection
- O(V+E) complexity is acceptable for task lists
- Provides clear feedback about which tasks form cycles

### 4. Premium Dark Mode UI
**Decision**: Chose dark mode as the primary theme with modern glassmorphism effects.

**Rationale**:
- Better for extended use (reduces eye strain)
- Modern, professional appearance
- Green/teal gradient aligns with "productivity" theme
- Stands out from basic bootstrap templates

### 5. Django REST Framework vs Plain Django
**Decision**: Used DRF for API endpoints.

**Rationale**:
- Built-in serialization and validation
- Better error handling
- Auto-generates browsable API (bonus for development)
- Industry standard for Django APIs
