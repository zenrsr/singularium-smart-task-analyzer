Overview
You will build a Smart Task Analyzer - a mini-application that intelligently scores and
prioritizes tasks based on multiple factors. This assignment tests your problem-solving
ability, algorithmic thinking, and clean code practices.

What We're Evaluating:
•
•
•
•

Algorithm Design (40%): Can you translate business requirements into logical
code?
Code Quality (30%): Clean, maintainable, well-structured code
Critical Thinking (20%): Handling edge cases and ambiguous requirements
Frontend Skills (10%): Functional user interface with good UX

Problem Statement
Create a task management system that intelligently scores and sorts tasks based on multiple
factors. Your system should help users identify which tasks they should work on first.

Part 1: Backend Development (Python/Django)
Estimated Time: 2 hours

Task Model Structure
Each task should have the following properties:
{ "title": "Fix login bug", "due_date": "2025-11-30", "estimated_hours": 3,
"importance": 8, // 1-10 scale "dependencies": [] // list of task IDs }

The Core Challenge: Design a Priority Algorithm
Create a scoring function that calculates task priority by considering multiple factors. Your
algorithm should intelligently weigh:
• Urgency: How soon is the task due? Past-due tasks should be weighted
appropriately.
• Importance: User-provided rating (1-10 scale)
• Effort: Lower effort tasks might be "quick wins" worth prioritizing
• Dependencies: Tasks that block other tasks should rank higher

Required API Endpoints
POST
/api/tasks/analyze/

Accept a list of tasks and return them sorted by priority
score. Each task should include its calculated score.

GET /api/tasks/suggest/

Return the top 3 tasks the user should work on today, with
explanations for why each was chosen.

Critical Considerations
•
•
•
•
•

How do you handle tasks with due dates in the past?
What if a task has missing or invalid data?
How do you detect circular dependencies?
Should your algorithm be configurable? (e.g., user preferences for weighting)
How do you balance competing priorities (urgent vs important)?

Part 2: Frontend Development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
Estimated Time: 1.5 hours

Required Interface Components
1. Input Section
•
•
•

Form to add individual tasks with all required fields
Option to paste JSON array of tasks for bulk input
Button to "Analyze Tasks" that calls your API

2. Output Section
•
•
•
•

Display sorted tasks with their calculated priority scores
Visual priority indicators (e.g., color coding: High/Medium/Low)
Show a brief explanation of why each task received its score
Display the task details (title, due date, effort, importance)

3. Critical Thinking Element (Important!)
Add a toggle or dropdown to switch between different sorting strategies:
• "Fastest Wins": Prioritize low-effort tasks
• "High Impact": Prioritize importance over everything
• "Deadline Driven": Prioritize based on due date
• "Smart Balance": Your custom algorithm that balances all factors

Frontend Requirements
•
•
•
•
•

Functional interface that successfully communicates with your API
Clean, readable code with proper event handling
Basic form validation before API calls
Error handling and user feedback (loading states, error messages)
Responsive design (should work on different screen sizes)

Bonus Challenges (Optional)
If you complete the core assignment early, consider implementing one or more of these
features:
• Dependency Graph Visualization: Detect and visually flag circular dependencies
(30-45 min)
• Date Intelligence: Consider weekends/holidays when calculating urgency (30 min)
• Eisenhower Matrix View: Display tasks on a 2D grid (Urgent vs Important) (45 min)
• Learning System: Allow users to mark if suggested tasks were helpful and adjust
algorithm (1 hour)
• Unit Tests: Write comprehensive tests for your scoring algorithm (45 min)
Note: Bonus challenges help us understand your technical depth, but quality on the core
assignment is more important than attempting bonuses.

Evaluation Criteria
Algorithm Quality
(40%)

• Does your scoring logic make sense?
• How do you handle edge cases?
• Is the algorithm flexible/configurable?
• Clear documentation of approach

Code Quality (30%)

• Clean, readable code structure
• Proper error handling
• Good variable/function naming
• Logical organization

Critical Thinking (20%)

• Handling ambiguous requirements
• Trade-off decisions
• Edge case awareness
• Creative problem-solving

Frontend (10%)

• Functional interface
• Good user experience
• Proper API integration
• Basic styling and responsiveness

Submission Requirements
1. GitHub Repository
Your repository should contain:
• Complete Django backend code
• Frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
• requirements.txt or Pipfile for Python dependencies
• README.md with setup instructions
• At least 3 unit tests for your scoring algorithm
• Clean commit history with meaningful commit messages

2. README.md Content
Your README should include:
• Setup Instructions: How to install dependencies and run the application
• Algorithm Explanation: How your priority scoring works (300-500 words)
• Design Decisions: Trade-offs you made and why
• Time Breakdown: Approximate time spent on each section
• Bonus Challenges: Which ones you attempted (if any)
• Future Improvements: What you'd do with more time

3. Technical Requirements
•
•
•
•

Python 3.8+ and Django 4.0+
Database: SQLite is fine (default Django setup)
No deployment required - just needs to run locally
No authentication system needed for this assignment

Submission Deadline: Please submit your GitHub repository link within 48 hours of
receiving this assignment.

Tips for Success
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Start with the algorithm: Spend time thinking through your scoring logic before
coding
Test edge cases: Make sure your code handles missing data, invalid inputs, and
unusual scenarios
Keep it simple first: Get a working solution, then refine and improve
Document as you go: Write comments explaining your reasoning, especially for the
algorithm
Commit frequently: Make meaningful commits that show your development process
Don't over-engineer: Focus on solving the problem well rather than adding
unnecessary complexity
Ask questions: If requirements are unclear, document your assumptions in the
README

Final Notes
This assignment is designed to see how you approach problems, structure your code, and
think through trade-offs. There's no single "correct" answer - we're interested in your thought
process and execution.
Focus on demonstrating clean code practices, solid problem-solving skills, and good
communication through your documentation. Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing
your submission!
